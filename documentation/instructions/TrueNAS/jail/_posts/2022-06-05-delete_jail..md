Most jails are created from a [Plugin](https://www.truenas.com/docs/hub/tasks/advanced/plugins/).

1.  In the Jails section, expand the Jail, and click the Delete option. Confirm the delete.
2.  In the jail-Jail drive pool, check to confirm there is no dataset for the Jail remaining. If there is one present, delete it.
3.  In the Snapshots section, delete any snapshots for the Jail.
4.  delete (or update) any documentation for the Jail.
