## terms

- client: the computer which you are ssh-ing FROM
- server: the computer which you are ssh-ing TO

## instructions

1.  On the client, generate the new key:
    1. Generate a new key with `ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "useful_name"`, where `useful_name` is something short and descriptive.
    2. for the name, use `<useful_name>_id_<key_type>`
    3. for the PW, press enter
2.  On the client, add the ssh key using `ssh-add ~/.ssh/<key_name>`
3.  On the client, add the ssh key to `~/.ssh/config`. The following is an example of a config.

        #ssh config
        IdentityFile ~/.ssh/github_id_rsa
        IdentityFile ~/.ssh/theseus_id_ed25519

4.  On the server, add the public key to the `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` file
5.  on the server, verify the authorized_keys file has read-write permissions to owner only.  Otherwise, run `chmod 0600 authorized_keys`
6.  Add the public key to a file on the Jenkins VM in `~/.ssh/`, if appropriate.
7.  Add entry to the ansible playbook, if appropriate.
