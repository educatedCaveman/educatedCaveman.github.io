When adding or replacing hardware, the general procedure is to open the physical host doc, and make the change. However, if the change is significant, or something like a network card, the network diagram may have to be updated as well.

For Mobius and Tesseract, there is specific documentation on adding/removing hard drives, located [here]({% post_url /documentation/instructions/TrueNAS/2022-06-05-truenas_add_disk %}) and [here]({% post_url /documentation/instructions/TrueNAS/2022-06-05-truenas_replace_disk %}).
