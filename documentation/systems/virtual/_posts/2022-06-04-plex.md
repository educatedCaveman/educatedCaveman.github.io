## Storage

- `/mnt/storage_node/Video/Movies/`
- `/mnt/storage_node/Video/TV-Shows/`
- `/mnt/storage_node/Music/`
- `/mnt/storage_node/Pictures/`
- `/mnt/storage_node/pr0n/`
- `/mnt/storage_node/Hegre/pics/`
- `/mnt/storage_node/Hegre/`

## Other Notes:

- no configs saved. all configuration done via the interface
- I thought it made sense to host tautulli on the same VM as plex. maybe also add ombi to this VM?
- the plex directory `/var/lib/plexmediaserver` is on the nvme_pool.
