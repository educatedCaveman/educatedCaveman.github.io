This is the site these documentation pages are hosted on. [This](https://docs.technotim.live/posts/jekyll-docs-site/) was the inspiration for this. Plus I was never completely satisfied with the documentation solution I had before. (a private git repo)

# Installation notes:

commands to run:

```shell
sudo pamac install ruby-bundler

bundle install
bundle exec jekyll serve
```

You can then navigate to [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000)
