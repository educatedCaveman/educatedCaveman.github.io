The following is only for docker applications, and Git repos.

## Flow

For each Git repo, when changes are committed, GitHub is configured to invoke a webhook pointed at Jenkins.  When Jenkins recieves the invocation, it will perform the acctions specified in the branch's Jenkinsfile.  Typically this is at minumum an ansible playbook deploying the updated repository to all hosts needing it.

the flow is as follows:

1. Local Machine:
    - makes edits
    - comits code to GitHub
2. GitHub
    - recieves the code
    - invokes the jenkins webhook
3. Jenkins:
    - recieves notification from GitHub
    - runs the steps specified in the Jenkinsfile.
        - at minumum, deploys code to hosts
        - can also restart services, etc.
    - if the code is for Docker, a portainer webhook will be invoked, which will re-create the stack.
    - sends Slack/Discord notifications
    - Informs GitHub of the build result.
