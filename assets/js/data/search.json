You will be asked to confirm the Partition type. It is a primary partition, which should be the default option. Select it with option p. Select the number of the partition you noted earlier. It will likely be 2. Use the default start sector (lowest value possible). Use the default end sector (largest value possible). Confirm you DO NOT want to remove the drive signature, by selecting option N. Re-print the new partition table with p, to confirm the changes were made. Run the following command to notify the OS of the change: partprobe /dev/sda Run the following command (replacing the drive letter and partition number as necessary) to resize the filesystem to take advantage of the new space: resize2fs /dev/sda2 If the volume to be expanded is managed by LVM, the following commands are needed/useful.

I’ve added firewall rules which prohibit any outgoing traffic from the VM_VLAN not on port 1195 (ExpressVPN uses 1195 instead of 1194 for OpenVPN) This aims to ensure the following: all internet traffic from this host (torrents, mostly) are always VPNed if the host VPN drops or otherwise failes silently, the firewall will prevent any internet traffic if the FW VPN fails while still allowing traffic (ExpressVPN - Amsterdam 1) the internet traffic is still encrypted. additionally, the config has been bound to the tun0 interface. this, combined with the above, should mean there is never a
